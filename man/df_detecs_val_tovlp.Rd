\title{Detections with validation labels based on temporal overlap}
\format{
## `df_detecs_val_tovlp` A data frame containing detections with
  validation labels and all the standard detection variables from the
  `match_n()` function output.
}
\usage{
df_detecs_val_tovlp
}
\description{
A data frame containing detections with validation labels assigned based on
temporal overlap with manually validated detections. The detections were
extracted from soundscape recordings with the `match_n()` function and
validated by comparing their temporal overlap with manually validated
detections in `df_detecs_val_manual`. Detections with sufficient temporal
overlap with true positives were labeled as true positives (TP), while those
without sufficient overlap were labeled as false positives (FP).
