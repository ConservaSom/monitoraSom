Description: `monitoraSom` is an R package designed to overcome the challenges of
    automated sound recognition and validation in bioacoustics. It provides a
    complete workflow for this purpose, including tools for segmentation,
    validation, and performance evaluation. Among its core functionalities, we
    highlight the graphical interfaces designed to accelerate manual
    segmentation of soundscape recordings and detection validation. Additionally,
    monitoraSom includes dedicated tools for validation diagnostics, offering
    quantitative assessments of detection performance. By addressing gaps in
    currently available tools, monitoraSom promotes data reproducibility and
    ensures methodological rigor. The modular design of the functions supports
    creative customization, encourages methodological experimentation, and
    reduces the learning curve associated with scripting. By consolidating
    these features, monitoraSom not only  reduces the learning curve associated
    with scripting but also empowers users to focus on ecological insights
    rather than technical hurdles, accelerating the transformation of raw
    acoustic data into actionable knowledge.
