#' Validate detections by overlap with Regions of Interest (ROIs)
#'
#' @description `r lifecycle::badge("experimental")`
#'
#' This function takes in two data frames, one containing Regions of Interest
#' (ROIs) and another containing detections. It then validates the detections by
#' checking for overlaps with the ROIs. The function returns a data frame with
#' the validated detections.
#'
#' @param df_rois A data frame containing Regions of Interest (ROIs) as in the
#'   output of `fetch_rois_n()`.
#' @param df_detecs A data frame containing detections as in the output of
#'   `fetch_score_peaks_n()`.
#' @param det_species A character string specifying the species to validate.
#'
#' @return A data frame with the validated detections.
#' @export
